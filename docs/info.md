## How it works

This project details the design and implementation of an 8-bit single-cycle microprocessor. The processor includes a register file and an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). The design was crafted to handle a simple instruction set architecture (ISA) that supports basic ALU operations, load/store operations, and status checks for the ALU carry -- all within less than a week. While the current version lacks a program counter and external memory, thus omitting any form of jump operations, it provides a solid foundation for understanding basic computational operations within a custom CPU architecture.

### ISCA Overview
The ISA is straightforward and is primarily focused on register operations and basic arithmetic/logic functions. Below is the breakdown of the instruction set:
```
// ISA --------------------------------------------------------------
//-- R level
`define MVR 4'b0000            // Move Register
`define LDB 4'b0001            // Load Byte into Regsiter
`define STB 4'b0010            // Store Byte from Regsiter
`define RDS 4'b0011            // Read (store) processor status
// 1'b0100 NOP
// 1'b0101 NOP
// 1'b0110 NOP
// 1'b0111 NOP

//-- Arithmatics
`define NOT {1'b1, `ALU_NOT}
`define AND {1'b1, `ALU_AND}
`define ORA {1'b1, `ALU_ORA}
`define ADD {1'b1, `ALU_ADD}
`define SUB {1'b1, `ALU_SUB}
`define XOR {1'b1, `ALU_XOR}
`define INC {1'b1, `ALU_INC}
// 1'b1111 NOP
```

## How to test

The processor has been tested through a suite of 12 testbenches, each designed to validate a specific functionality or operation. These testbenches cover basic ALU operations, data movement between registers, and the load/store functionalities. Although basic operational tests are passing, timing interactions between instructions have not been exhaustively verified, and it is anticipated that a sophisticated compiler would handle these timing considerations effectively, reminiscent of approaches taken in historical computing systems.

## External hardware

Currently, the processor does not interface with any external hardware components. It operates entirely within a simulated environment where all inputs and outputs are managed through testbenches. This setup is ideal for educational purposes or for foundational experimentation in CPU design.
